# ZPR2: Joint Zero Pronoun Recovery and Resolution using Multi-Task Learning and BERT

Code corresponding to our paper "[ZPR2: Joint Zero Pronoun Recovery and Resolution using Multi-Task Learning and BERT]()" published at ACL 2020.
We provide our scripts for preprocessing the data, but we can't release data due to the copyright issue.
Please contact the origin authors for data access.

Our later work ```RAST: Domain-Robust Dialogue Rewriting as Sequence Tagging``` is based on this project by using a BERT+multi-task learning framework to handle various types of coreference and zero anaphora situations. For those who would like to develop your project based on this repo, we had a better [implementation](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/RaST-plus/blob/main/SequenceTagger.py) in that work.
